# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a Movie Recommendation System as part of a programming assignment in the "Knowledge Discovery from Databases" course. The system utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user ratings.

## Features
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes user-item interactions to make predictions.
- **Multiple Similarity Measures**: Supports both Cosine and Pearson similarity metrics.
- **Flexible Experimentation**: Allows for different configurations of training/testing splits and neighborhood sizes.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates MAE (Mean Absolute Error), Precision, and Recall to evaluate recommendation quality.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **SciPy**: For efficient storage of sparse matrices.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning utilities.
- **Multiprocessing**: To enhance performance through parallel processing.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/VaratisG/MovieRecommendationSystem.git
cd MovieRecommendationSystem

2. Install the required packages:
pip install pandas numpy scipy scikit-learn

3. Run an experiment:
python RecommendationSystem.py -1 # Replace -1 with -2 or -3 for other experiments

## Experiments
The project includes three main experiments to evaluate the recommendation system:

1. **Experiment 1**: Evaluates different neighborhood sizes (N) using a fixed training set ratio (T = 80%).
2. **Experiment 2**: Compares performance across different training set ratios (T = 50%, 70%, 90%) using the optimal N from Experiment 1.
3. **Experiment 3**: Tests various filtering combinations (M, M') to observe their effects on recommendation density and performance metrics.

## Results
The results from the experiments indicate that:
- The optimal neighborhood size is N = 20, balancing accuracy and recall.
- A training set ratio of T = 70% yields the best balance between precision and recall.
- Increasing the density of the rating matrix significantly improves the model's performance.

For detailed results, refer to the attached report or the output generated by running the experiments.
